# Would You Rather Poll App

This is the final assessment project designed for Udacity's React & Redux course as part of the React Nanodegree Program.

It is a web app that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

In the app, users will be able to answer questions, see which questions they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.

Details about the mock backend server and original project instructions can be found in the starter code's [README.md](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-would-you-rather-starter/blob/master/README.md).
